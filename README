Inotify is on erlang port for the Linux inotify API allowing one to monitor
changes to files and directory in the filesystem.

Documentation
-------------

Most documentation is here:
http://sheyll.github.com/inotify/

For an example refer to the unit test:
https://github.com/sheyll/inotify/blob/master/test/inotify_test.erl


You might want to have the documentation locally, this can be achieved by

$ ./rebar doc

which generates HTML documentation in the "doc" sub directory.

In short, you can do anything you want with the code including using it as part
of you plan for world domination (if your successful can I have one of the nicer
countries please). No responsiblity it taken for the fitness of the any purpose,
etc, etc. The only thing I ask is that if you find a bug and fix send me the
patch. Likewise, feature suggestions and patches are welcome.
