Introduction
------------
Inotify is on erlang port for the Linux inotify API allowing one to monitor
changes to files and directory in the filesystem.

Documentation
-------------

Most documentation is here:
http://sheyll.github.com/inotify/

For an example refer to the unit test:
https://github.com/sheyll/inotify/blob/master/test/inotify_test.erl


You might want to have the documentation locally, this can be achieved by

$ ./rebar doc

which generates HTML documentation in the "doc" sub directory.


License
-------
In short, you can do anything you want with the code including using it as part
of you plan for world domination (if your successful can I have one of the nicer
countries please). No responsiblity it taken for the fitness of the any purpose,
etc, etc. The only thing I ask is that if you find a bug and fix send me the
patch. Likewise, feature suggestions and patches are welcome.

TODO
----
* add support for multiple controller functions
* Write some documentation!
